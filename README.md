🚀 Google Landing Page Clone with Tailwind CSS! 🎨

I just built a Google Landing Page Clone using Tailwind CSS! 💻✨

This project was a great way to explore Tailwind’s utility-first approach and recreate a clean, responsive UI with minimal CSS.

✅ Key Highlights:
🔹 Fully responsive design 📱💻
🔹 Pixel-perfect recreation of Google's homepage 🔍
🔹 Built entirely with Tailwind CSS for efficiency & speed

It was a fun and insightful experience working with Tailwind, and I’m excited to apply it to more projects! 🚀
